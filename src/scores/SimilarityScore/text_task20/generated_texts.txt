Canon is the best choice for the majority of photographers, as it has a wide range of lenses to choose from, and a wide range of cameras to choose from. However, Nikon is a great choice for those who want to shoot with a DSLR.

If you're a beginner, you can get a great deal on the Nikon D800 for under $300. If you're a professional, you can get a great deal on the Nikon D810 for under $400.


I'm not going to say which one is better, but if you're shooting with the Canon body, you'll be able to get the same image quality you get with the Nikon.

It's hard to say. OpenGL is a fairly mature API, and it's not as easy to port to different platforms as Direct3D. The OpenGL ES 3.0 API is very similar to Direct3D, and it's not as easy to port to different platforms as Direct3D.

The OpenGL ES 3.0 API is a very mature API, and it's not as easy to port to different platforms as Direct3D.

What's the biggest thing


The answer is yes, in that OpenGL is faster than Direct3D. In fact, OpenGL is faster than Direct3D in many cases. For example, in our testing, OpenGL is faster than Direct3D in the following scenarios:

In OpenGL, the rendering pipeline is much more efficient, which is especially important for the rendering of complex graphics, such as in games.

The rendering pipeline is much more efficient, which is especially important for the rendering of complex graphics,


I don't think so. OpenGL is a very complex toolkit and I don't think it's going to be as easy to port to other platforms as Direct3D. I think the only way to really get it to work is to actually implement it. The OpenGL API is very complex and there's no easy way to do it.

How about the graphics drivers?

The graphics drivers are really the only thing that makes OpenGL work on a modern computer. The OpenGL API


Yes, OpenGL is better for portability. The only problem is that some of the OpenGL drivers are not optimized for the new hardware, and the OpenGL drivers are not optimized for the new hardware. For example, the OpenGL drivers for the Intel® HD Graphics 3000 series are not optimized for the new Intel® HD Graphics 3000 series.

If you're using the OpenGL drivers for the Intel® HD Graphics 3000 series, you can use the OpenGL ES 2.0 API with the new Intel


I think it is. Direct3D is a great tool for porting games, but it is not a great tool for porting games to different platforms. You can port a game to Linux, but it's not a great port. It's not a great port because OpenGL is not as good as Direct3D.
